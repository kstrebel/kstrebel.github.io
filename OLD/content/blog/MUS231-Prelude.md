I wrote this piece as a prelude to my [Fugue in D Minor](../mus231-fugue/).  The fugue itself has a dark, serious feel to it, and I wanted to contrast that.  I wrote the prelude as the calm before the storm.  I wanted it to be light and carefree; bouncy yet songlike.  This was originally written for just piano, but I think the nature of the flute makes it a good cantidate to play the melody, and the strings in the background give this piece an overall calming feel that I quite like.

Although this piece uses virtual instruments, my goal is to one day make a recording with all live performances.
