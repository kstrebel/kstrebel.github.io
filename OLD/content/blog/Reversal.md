Reversal is a 2D platformer where, depending on which side of the ground they are on, gravity might be reversed.  The player's goal was to get to the end having collected as many pink dots as possible, sometimes having to hit switches for doors along the way.

Reversal was the first DigiPen game I did sound for.  I was still learning how to use a DAW, and I remember just clicking around on synths until I found ones that sounded cool.  I don't think I was focusing on chords too much.  Instead, I think I ended up playing along with what I had already recorded until I found something that sounded kind of like it belonged.  And then I exported it, tidied up the loop point, and gave it to my team.

I didn't post this here as an example of my sill as a composer, I want this to be a reminder to myself and to others that we all start somewhere.  That we all have to learn how to use a DAW, learn how to write music, learn how to put instruments together.  It isn't an example of where I am, but instead where I've come from.
