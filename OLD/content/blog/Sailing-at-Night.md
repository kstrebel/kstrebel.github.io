This is the second piece I wrote for the game Lamb Planet. <LP link goes here> Our plan was to have a solo piano play while the player sails on the open ocean.  I wanted to base the piece on a repeated pattern: something that would start to feel familiar to the listener but also keep the piece moving forward.  To complement that, I wanted to have a simple, singable melody with plenty of space to give the piece its relaxed and almost familiar feeling.  Although the day/night cycle was cut from the game, I'm very happy with how this turned out as a standalone piece.
