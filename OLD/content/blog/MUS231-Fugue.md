From the start, I wanted this peice to have something to do with a battle.  It's written as what one would hear in a movie when the forces of good are marching down the path to the evil kingdom, with about fifty seconds in depicting a clash with some evil soldiers.  
This piece is the first one where I actually tried my hand at orchestration.  It was originally written for piano, but one piano by itself doesn't have nearly the variety of timbres I was going for.  Looking back, I notice parts of it that I would orchestrate differently now, but I'm happy with what I was able to make at the time.
